INSTALLATION AND TEST
==============================
You can compile the sources includes or use the pre-compiled binaries (JAR files). 


Software requirements
=========================
The only software requirement to execute the system is the Java Run Time 
Environment version 1.5 and the Android SDK.
The Java Compiler version 1.5, to build the and the ANT program to compile the source code of 
chatStandard with build.xml file, ANT is available from http://jakarta.apache.org.
The Android SDK at the last version is available at http://developer.android.com/sdk. 

Getting the software
========================
All the software is distributed under the LGPL license limitations. 
It can be downloaded from the JADE web site 
http://jade.tilab.com/ Five compressed files are available:
1. the source code of JADE-LEAP
2. the source code of the demo
3. the documentation, including the javadoc of the JADE API and 
this programmer's guide
4. the binary of JADE, i.e. the jar files with all the Java classes
5. a full distribution with all the previous files


Running chatStandard from the binary distribution
=============================================
Having uncompressed the archive file, a directory tree is generated whose 
root is jade and with a lib and a bin subdirectory. The lib subdirectory contains 
the JAR files of the JADE-LEAP release 4.1 platform and the Ontology that is the
same for client and server.

To run the client side platform on the android emluator or device you need
to install the chatClient.apk available in the bin directory; to do this
we suggest to read the Android SDK documentation.
